## Important Info

These are projects created for my "Principles of Computer Science" (CS 1150) and "Data Structures and Algorithms" (CS 1450) classes at UCCS (Summer 2022 &amp; Fall 2022 semesters respectively). They showcase various concepts like object-oriented programming, data structures, etc.

This project was built with the following tools:
   - Java
   - Apache NetBeans IDE
   - Eclipse IDE
   - Visual Studio Code

This project helped me learn the following:
Principles of Computer Science
   - `AsciiArt.java`:           Intro to Java
   - `CompoundInterest.java`:   Variables
   - `ShouldIPostThis.java`:    If statements
   - `LoginCreator.java`:       Boolean logic
   - `Shapes.java`:             For loops
   - `ShapesWithMethods.java`   Methods
   - `Decrypter.java`           Encryption & Decryption
   - `Movies.java`              Arrays
   - `Music.java`               Classes & Objects
   - `MailOrder.java`           Array Lists
   - `Pizzeria.java`            Inheritance
   - `MusicWithFiles.java`      File handling

Data Structures and Algorithms
   - `RandomSorting.java`       Libraries
   - `TourDeTurtles.java`       Inheritance

## Project Overview

This a collection of Java projects from both of the Java classes I took.

## Running the Files

1. Clone the repository.

2. Open the `java-projects` folder in Visual Studio Code.
    - Ensure the `Extension Pack for Java` is installed.
    - This project is configured with the `java-projects` directory as the root.
        - This makes it easy to run all files with only one editor open.
        - *Trying to run the files any other way may require code and path changes.*

3. Navigate to desired Java project.

4. Open the file that shares its name with the project.
    - For example, open `MusicWithFiles.java` if the project name is `project 12 - music with files`.

5. Click the run button in the editor to run the file.
