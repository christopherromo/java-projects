## Important Info

These are projects created for my "Principles of Computer Science" (CS 1150) and "Data Structures and Algorithms" (CS 1450) classes at UCCS (Summer 2022 &amp; Fall 2022 semesters respectively). They showcase various concepts like object-oriented programming, data structures, etc.

This project was built with the following tools:
   - Java
   - Apache NetBeans IDE
   - Eclipse IDE
   - Visual Studio Code

This project helped me learn the following:  
  
*Principles of Computer Science*
   - `AsciiArt.java`
      - Intro to Java
   - `CompoundInterest.java`
      - Variables
   - `ShouldIPostThis.java`
      - If Statements
   - `LoginCreator.java`
      - Boolean Logic
   - `Shapes.java`
      - Loops
   - `ShapesWithMethods.java`
      - Methods
   - `Decrypter.java`
      - Caesar Cipher
   - `Movies.java`
      - Arrays
   - `Music.java`
      - Classes & Objects
   - `MailOrder.java`
      - Array Lists
   - `Pizzeria.java`
      - Inheritance
   - `MusicWithFiles.java`
      - File Handling
  
*Data Structures and Algorithms*
   - `RandomSorting.java`
      - Libraries
   - `TourDeTurtles.java`
      - Inheritance
   - `Dogs.java`
      - Abstract Classes & Interfaces
   - `Transportation.java`
      - Array Lists     
   - `Stacks.java`
      - Stacks
   - `TransportationWithQueues.java`
      - Queues & Priority Queues   
   - `MessageDecoder.java`
      - Iterators
   - `ParrotTrain.java`
      - Linked Lists
   - `TreeOfLife.java`
      - Binary Trees

# Java Projects

#### Created by Christopher Romo
#### CS 1150 Principles of Computer Science : Summer 2022
#### CS 1450 Data Structures and Algorithms : Fall 2022

## Project Overview

This a collection of Java projects from both of the Java classes I took. These are the very first programs I have ever written, with some focusing on very simple concepts. With each project, I learned more about Java and programming languages in general.

## Running the Files

1. Clone the repository.

2. Open the `java-projects` directory in Visual Studio Code.
    - Ensure the `Extension Pack for Java` is installed.
    - This project is configured with the `java-projects` directory as the root.
        - This makes it easy to run all files with only one editor open.
        - *Trying to run the files any other way may require code and path changes.*

3. Navigate to the desired Java project.

4. Open the Java file that shares its name with the project directory.
    - For example, open `MusicWithFiles.java` if the project directory name is `project 12 - music with files`.

5. Click the run button in the editor to run the file.
